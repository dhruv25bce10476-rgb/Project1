#Project : Digit Finding Program
This is my first project on GitHub.

## What the project does?
This program involves taking an integer n input till which the numbers from 1 to n are stored.
It  tries to store digits in a separate list and attempts to find the mth digit in the sequence
Lastly it takes another input to find where the rth digit came from which number.

## Why this project is helpful?
This program involves the use of explicit type casting of string and use of for loop and string indexing. Anyone trying to learn basics of for loop, range function, string indexing , this small project can be your starting place.
